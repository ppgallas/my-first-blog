This is my take on Django Girls Tutorial in Django. 

You can watch the site working on www.ppgallas.pythonanywhere.com but not with all the functionalities.

I migrated the database to PostgreSQL, so pythonanywhere won't handle it in free version.

I applied some more functionalities, so now it is possible to:

 - post images

 - have drafts of posts

 - add comments

 - authenticate users
