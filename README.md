This is my take on Django Girls Tutorial in Django. 

You can watch the site working on ppgallas.pythonanywhere.com but not with all the functionalities, due to limitations of pythonanywhere free version of hosting (also use naked URL).

I migrated the database to PostgreSQL, so pythonanywhere won't handle it now.

I applied some more functionalities, so now it is possible to:

 - post images

 - have drafts of posts

 - add comments

 - authenticate users
